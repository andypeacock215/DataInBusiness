# Data In Business

In this project I was given the following scenario:

## Scenario Background
"Paws & Whiskers" is a growing pet shop that aims to improve its business by analysing sales, customer information, and inventory data. Currently, the data is collected manually or stored in spreadsheets. Management is interested in transitioning to Microsoft Azure to streamline data storage, analysis, and reporting, enabling them to make data-driven decisions.

This is how I would explain to management about their options:

 •	Conduct regular audits to ensure data accuracy and compliance.


### Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018

The DPA 2018 builds on GDPR, applying specifically to the UK. It outlines lawful bases for data processing, including consent, contract fulfilment, and legal obligations. For businesses like “Paws & Whiskers,” compliance involves:

•	Understanding which lawful basis applies to each data processing activity.

•	Handling special categories of data (e.g., health information for pet vaccinations) with additional care.

•	Ensuring accountability through documented processes and policies.


### Other Industry Standards

•	PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): If “Paws & Whiskers” accepts card payments, compliance with PCI DSS is essential to protect sensitive payment data. This includes encrypting cardholder data and maintaining secure network environments.

•	PECR (Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations):
These regulations govern the use of electronic communications for marketing. “Paws & Whiskers” must obtain clear consent before sending promotional emails or text messages to customers.
